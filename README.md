<u>Repo for upgrading GISTEMP v4.0 (last updated in 2016) to v5.0</u>

GISTEMP (GISS Surface Temperature Analysis) is an estimate of the global surface temperature change. The basic GISS temperature analysis scheme was defined in the late 1970s by James Hansen, when a method of estimating global temperature change was needed for comparison with 1-D global climate models. This analysis method was fully documented in [Hansen and Lebedeff 1987](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha00700d.html). Several papers describing the updates to the analysis followed, most recently that of [Hansen et al. (2010)](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha00510u.html) and [Lenssen et al. (2019)](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/le05800h.html).
