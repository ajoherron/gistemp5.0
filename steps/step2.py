Step 2: Adjusting urban stations

An urban station must meet various criteria to have its trend adjusted:
    - Must have sufficient nearby rural stations
    - Their combined record must have enough overlap with the urban station

If the urban station does not meet the criteria, it is discarded.
All stations with short records are discarded.
